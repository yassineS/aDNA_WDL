# aDNA_WDL
This is a WDL pipeline for Ancient DNA. It reflects a modern data processing strategy used by the ACAD human genomics team, and in re-processing the data released with OAGR - v05-2019.


# System configuration
To integrate the WDL pipeline and the Cromwell executor with your HPC platform, we recommend the use of one of the Cromwell configuration templates in: https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/cromwell.example.backends.
These files offer integration with a wide range of paltforms, and we highly recommend the use of Singularity or Docker on you system to increase reproducibility.
